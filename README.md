# JupyterLab extension-cookiecutter-ts

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for creating
a JupyterLab extension in TypeScript. (See also
[extension-cookiecutter-js](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-js)
for an extension in CommonJS.)

## Use the template to create package

Install cookiecutter.

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

Use cookiecutter to generate a package, following the prompts to fill in the name and authorship of your new JupyterLab extension.

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts
```

If you'd like to generate a package for a specific JupyterLab release, use the `--checkout` option and give a tag or commit from this repository.

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts --checkout v0.34
```

## A simple example

The ``src/`` directory of your new extension includes a very simple example of a working extension, written in TypeScript. Use this example as a guide to build your own extension.
